#For the generation of first half of the loop, go to first_half folder and run run_first_half.sh using command "sh run_first_half.sh"

#The second half of the loop will be generted in reverse order. Go to second_half_opposite folder and do sh run_second_half_opposite.sh


#Please note that the first half and second half can be generated simultaneously.
#Once both the halves are generated, the loop can be stitched together in mix_n_match folder by running sh run.sh   Please change the paths in mix_two_halves.m based on the location of your .mat files generated by first and second halves.


# Once any changes are made in any ".m" file, the executable will need to be regerated using mcc -R -nodisplay -R -singleCompThread -m mix_two_halves.m


# All the conformations generated after running the code are stored in output_structures folder as all_cond.netcdf file using the provided Dropbox link. They can be converted to PDBs using CPPTRAJ utility. pos_1.pdb in the output folder can be used as the parameter file to get the rest of the structures from the trajectories. 

#
# Requirements for running code: 
# Matlab R-2016 version
# Access to multiple CPUs. The script can be executed using 1 processor as well but the speed will be quite slow as each job will run one by one.
