# Streptavidin-Biotin-Binding-Study-Using-the-Movable-Type-Method
# This repository includes all necessary codes written in octave and bash for reproducing the free energy calculation in the work, The Role of the Active Site Flap in Streptavidin/Biotin Complex Formation, published in the Journal of American Chemical Society (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2018, 140 (16), pp 5434â€“5446). 
# Matlab R-2016 version is required to perform the calculation in order to precisely reproduce the results. Necessary data files exceeding the Github file size limit are provided in a dropbox folder which can be downloaded using the link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ejf7udsql3t59f9/AACOZ_cT5Pqzn42E-q07iHx0a?dl=0
# Calculation result data files can also be downloaded using this dropbox link for the record if the users would like to compare with their own calculation results.
