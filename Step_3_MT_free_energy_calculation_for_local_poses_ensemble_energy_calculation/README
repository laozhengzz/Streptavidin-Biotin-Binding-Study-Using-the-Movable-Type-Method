#THe main executable is "GARF_MT_EXE_pro_dockedligand". It can be run via run_mtfe_docking.sh. Please change the necessary paths in the run_mtfe_docking.sh and run_mtfe_docking.pbs to execute your free energy code. 

# It will generate all the individual components of the free energy code. 

## The net expression of free energies:

# Apo protein = P_Tor + P_Non/(RcutoffPP*10) + ZE_P_san 

# Holo protein = P_Tor + P_Non/(RcutoffPP*10) + COM/RcutoffPL + ZE_PL_san

#Binding affinity = (P_Tor + P_Non/(RcutoffPP*10) + COM/RcutoffPL + ZE_PL_san + ZE_PL_water*(-0.03)) - (P_Tor + P_Non/(RcutoffPP*10) + ZE_P_san -ZE_L_san)

where, RcutoffPP=6 and RcutoffPL=6
P_Tor = Torsion of Apo protein
P_Non = Intra protein non-bonded interactions
ZE_P_san = Protein solvation
ZE_L_san = Ligand solvation
COM = Inter Protein-ligand interaction
ZE_PL_san = Protein ligand solvation
ZE_PL_water = water compensation with a parameter of 0.03
